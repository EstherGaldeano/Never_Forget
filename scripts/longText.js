        $('#textFin').text('Location: Plaça del Diamant Shelter Lluís went to the Plaça del Diamant shelter to wait for the bombs to stop before going home. But they didn’t stop, not for three days. It was the worst attack waged on Barcelona at the time. A total of 45,000 kg of bombs was dropped on the city by the fascist Italian air fleet. They left 551 dead and 1,151 wounded, in addition to completely destroying 76 buildings and seriously damaging around a hundred more. January 19, 1938 - I need to go home. I hope Pau is OK. He should be home by now. Pau, Lluís’ only son, is 16 years old and goes to school close to his home in Gràcia. Laia, Pau’s mother, died in childbirth. That was a hard blow for Lluís, but when he looks at his son, he knows he has to carry on for him and for Laia. “Your mother would be proud of us, Pau.” Upon arriving home, Lluís went pale. The building he lived in had been entirely destroyed by the bombs. His home of 30 years was now a pile of debris. - Oh my god, Pau! My son! No! He has to be here, I’m sure he got out in time... Lluís checks all the shelters in the neighborhood and shows everyone the photo of Pau he carries in his wallet. Nobody has seen him. Feeling truly desperate now, Lluís heads back to what’s left of his home and searches through the wreckage. He has no luck, though; there’s not a trace of Pau to be found. The days go by and there’s still no sign of his son. Lluís fears the worst. Then, his grief becomes rage, a rage so strong that he climbs Turó de la Rovira and signs up as a volunteer for...');

        $('#textFin').text('Location: Turó de la Rovira bunkers Introduction to the test: Starting in 1937, numerous air strikes were waged against Barcelona both to achieve military goals and to terrorize the population. In response, four 105 mm guns were installed at the top of Turó de la Rovira. Together with the Sant Pere Martir installations, the goal was to establish Barcelona’s anti-aircraft axis. January 30, 1938 07:00 h Lluís was sitting down, looking out over the city of Barcelona when Joan, another volunteer, approached. - Joan: Beautiful, isn’t it? - Lluís: Excuse me? - Joan: Barcelona. The views from up here are incredible. What they’re doing is atrocious. There’s just no justice. When will it be over? - Lluís: It’s already over for me. I don’t really have anything left to lose. Joan sees that Lluís is holding a photo of Pau in his hands. - Joan: Did you lose him on the front? - Lluís: No. He went missing during the air strike that lasted three days. Our house was bombed and there’s nothing left. I couldn’t find him in the neighborhood shelters either. - Joan: May I? Joan reaches his hand out to Lluís. He hands over his only remaining photo of his son; all the others were buried beneath the debris. Joan looks at the photo and hesitates. - Joan: Hey, buddy, your son looks really familiar. I swear I’ve seen him somewhere before... - Joan: Yes! He was there! He was wounded in the air strike and went to the S Felip Neri church for first aid. His name is Pau, rig - Lluís: Yes! That’s my son! Do you know where he might  - Joan: No, I’m sorry. I was just passing through to lend a hand with the wounded  then I came here. But he was OK. He just had superficial wounds. You should go ask aro the Lluís gets up and starts walking downhi - Lluís: I’ll head straight there! Thank you, frie - Joan: Good luck!');

        $('#textFin').text('Location: Plaça de Sant Felip Neri Just before arriving to Plaça de Sant Felip Neri, Lluís sees a fleet of Italian SM.79s fly over. The city is under attack yet again. - There’s no time to hide. I have to make it to the church. It’s the only trace of Pau I have. I can’t lose him again. Lluís makes it to the square and the panorama couldn’t be bleaker. The center of the square had been bombed and everything was destroyed. People were running to take shelter in the church, but, just then, another bomb fell, striking it. That day, the city sustained two air strikes by Italian SM.79s at 8:55 h and 11:25 h. The attacks were centered over the city center, the port and Barceloneta. The first strike in Plaça de Sant Felip Neri came at 9:11 h. Two bombs rained down on the picturesque square. The first landed in the center of the square and, to this day, you can see how its shrapnel pockmarked the facade of the church. The second hit the roof of the church and, unfortunately, did not explode until it landed in the basement, where dozens of orphan children had taken shelter. The second air strike came just two hours later, at 11:11 h. At that point, the square was full of volunteers who had come to offer first aid to the wounded. It was the first display of what would later become known as carpet bombing. The first indiscriminate attack designed to break the network of solidarity, killing 42 people, the majority of which were children. Lluís helped as many of the wounded to leave the church as possible. It was a massacre. First, a shelter hosting dozens of children had been bombed. Shortly thereafter, another bomb was launched on the same place, thus killing the people who had come to help. - They’re just children. Why would they do this? What do they gain? They’re just kids, God damn it! Heartless bastards! How could they do this? Lluís broke down crying. He was surrounded by the bodies of children. Innocent children who had only just begun life. He was staring the ugliest side of war right in the face. Then, he felt a presence behind him. It was the church pastor. He was wounded and his robe was shredded and tattered. He had been preparing mass when the first bomb fell. Miraculously, he managed to get out with just a serious concussion. He then helped the rest of the wounded. - Pastor: Thanks for your help. Many children have survived thanks to you. - Lluís: Not enough. - Pastor: ... - Pastor: You don’t look familiar. You’re not from this neighborhood, are you? - Lluís: No. I was searching for my son, Pau. I’ve been looking for him for days and a friend told me he saw him here after the air strike. He was hurt and came here for help. - Pastor: Pau? A boy of about 15? Blond? Are you Lluís? - Lluís: Yes. Is he here? - Pastor: No, not anymore. Once he was better, Pau went home. He told me it had been destroyed and he didn’t know where you were. He went to the factory where you work but they said they hadn’t seen you since the air strike The last thing he said was that he’d go check if anybody had seen you at...');

He got there as fast as he could, hoping to finally find Pau or at least find out more about where he might be. Upon arriving, he found several citizens repairing the entrance to the bunker, which had been damaged in the last strike. Unlike other shelters, Refugi 307 had been built at ground level, taking advantage of the Montjuïc mountain. - Lluís: Good afternoon. Sorry to bother you, but have you seen this boy around here? One of the men approached. - Martí: Ah, yes, Pau. He’s been here helping us repair the damage to the bunker for a few days now. He came looking for his father. That must be you. - Lluís: Yes, I’m his father. Do you know where he is now? - Martí: Well, we needed some material to fix the bunker door and he went with my son to get it. They should have come back already but I guess they’ve been held up. You can wait here if you like. - Lluís: Yes, of course. Do you need a hand with that? Night came and Pau still hadn’t returned. Perhaps there wasn’t any material left or there was a problem transporting it, Lluís thought. He had no choice but to wait once more. To thank him for helping with the bunker, Martí invites Lluís to his home to spend the night. A scream wakes Lluís in the morning. It’s Martí’s wife. - Martí’s wife: The Nationalists have taken over the city! They’re everywhere! Lluís jumps out of bed and leaves the house with Martí only to observe that, indeed, Barcelona has fallen. Suddenly, Lluís receives a blow to the head and everything goes black...

The cell was bursting with prisoners, but maybe not for long. Rumor had it the next step was execution. Dad? - Lluís: It can’t be... Indeed, Pau had also been taken prisoner. The Nationalists had intercepted the transportation of material for the bunkers and arrested his son. They finally found each other, but in the worst case scenario: on death row in a fortress with no escape. - Pau: I knew you weren’t dead! I knew it! - Lluís: I’ve imagined finding you over and over again, but never like this. - Pau: Don’t worry, Dad. We’re planning an escape. Listen, here’s what we’re going to do... The Nationalists had taken over Montjuïc just hours earlier. They hadn’t yet had time to block all the exits. Lluís and Pau’s cell mate, a former guard at the castle, knew those exits like the back of his hand. Lined up in the courtyard to be executed, a Catalan spy among the Nationalists throws a smoke bomb, creating total chaos and the opportunity they had planned for. They went down into the sewer before the smoke dissipated and ran through countless passageways before finally seeing the light at the end of the tunnel. Free again, but for how long? Nobody knows for sure but, from now on, at least they would be facing it all together.');
